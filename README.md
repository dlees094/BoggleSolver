BoggleSolver
============

Solves the game Boggle given a random board or a board you put in yourself (not implemented yet).
The dictionary is based on the linux /usr/share/dict/words with special character words,
words less than three letters and words with apostrophes removed.

TODO
============

1.	Allow the user to have the option of inserting a board instead of randomly generating.
2.	Create a logger instead of using the default logger.
3.	Make a more appealing GUI.
